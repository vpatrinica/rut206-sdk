* Some board-specific defines here, such as :
* - USB strings
* - LED pin assignments and polarity
* - other special pins to control CAN transceivers.
*
* CAN_S_PIN: Some CAN transceivers (e.g. TJA1050) have a "Silent mode in which the transmitter is disabled";
* enabled with this 'S' pin. If undefined, the corresponding code will be disabled.
*
* TERM_Pin: Add support for an externally controlled terminating resistor
